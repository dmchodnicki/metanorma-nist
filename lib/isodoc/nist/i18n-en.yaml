draft-wip-boilerplate: This document is currently under development. The draft is not yet complete, and organizations should not attempt to implement it. The content is in an early stage of development, rough, incomplete and experimental; it has not been extensively edited or vetted. This provides an insider view of the iterative process to develop the content and it gives NIST an opportunity to share early thoughts, ideas, and approaches with the community. NIST welcomes early informal feedback and comments, which will be adjudicated after the specified public comment period.
draft-prelim-boilerplate: This document incorporates comments from the work-in-progress draft. It is a relatively cohesive document and is considered stable, although there are gaps in the content and the overall document is incomplete. Some changes are expected. Organizations may consider experimenting with guidelines, with the understanding that they will identify gaps and challenges. NIST welcomes early informal feedback and comments, which will be adjudicated after the specified public comment period; a full public draft is expected to follow.
draft-public-boilerplate: This draft represents a complete document that is released for public comment as part of NIST’s official review process, in support of an open and transparent process for developing guidelines and standards. The language is normalized and is consistent throughout the document. Comments received during previous review cycles (if any) have been adjudicated and are addressed in this release. Early adopters may attempt to implement the guidelines in a test or development environment; however, comments received on this draft may cause NIST to determine that a subsequent public draft and comment period is necessary. The content of this document will not be considered as “final” until formally published and announced by NIST.
