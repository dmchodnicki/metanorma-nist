WARNING: This gem is still under development.

== Functionality

This gem processes Metanorma documents into the NIST document class.

It provides the following functions:

. Compiles Metanorma input into the Metanorma-NIST XML format
. Validates XML output against the Metanorma-NIST document model
** Errors are reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.
. Metanorma-NIST XML is then converted into desired output formats.

The following outputs are supported:

* Primary: the canonical Metanorma-NIST XML representation (`.xml`).
* Secondary: the Metanorma-NIST XML representation is processed to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable NIST documents.
** HTML (`.html`)
** PDF (`.pdf`)
** Word (`.doc`)

== Structure

This gem inherits from the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc
gem, and aligns closely to it.


=== Quickstart

Please see https://www.metanorma.com for instructions to get started.

If you are using a Mac, the https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup
repository has instructions on setting up your machine to run Metanorma
scripts such as this one. You need only run the following in a Terminal console:

[source,console]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riboseinc/metanorma-macos-setup/master/metanorma-setup)
$ gem install metanorma-cli
$ gem install metanorma-nist
----


== Usage

Using the `metanorma` CLI:

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma --type ogc a.adoc                   # output HTML
$ metanorma --type ogc --extensions html a.adoc # output just HTML
$ metanorma --type ogc --extensions xml a.adoc  # output Metanorma XML
----


== Authoring

Please refer to the Metanorma-ISO documentation for general documentation.

* Metanorma-ISO general documentation: https://www.metanorma.com/software/metanorma-iso/

* Metanorma-ISO guidance: https://www.metanorma.com/software/metanorma-iso/docs/guidance/


////
** http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketing terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.
////


== Approach

=== Document model

The NIST SP 800 document model is detailed here:

* https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-nist[NIST SP 800 document model]

It is an instance of the
https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-model-standoc[StandardDocument model].


=== Document input

Document input to Metanorma is for the compilation of content into the
Metanorma XML document.

The Metanorma-NIST processor supports AsciiDoc input.

Similar to Markdown, AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup format, but
combines the rigor and expressivity of DocBook.
A number of editors (through plugins) support preview of AsciiDoc files,
so textual content can be previewed without running the Metanorma toolchain.

The Metanorma processor automates numbering of headings, figures,
tables etc, automatically generates references and citations,
and  the resulting output presentations.

NOTE: The Asciidoctor gem is used for AsciiDoc input parsing.


== Document attributes

=== Common attributes

Metadata of the document is provided through AsciiDoc document attributes.

https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[Metanorma-Standoc]
documents all common Metanorma document attributes.

////
TODO.

Where these preexisting metanorma attributes correspond to attributes already used
by NIST in their Asciidoctor template, they are treated as synonyms of the Metanorma
attributes.

The attributes relevant to OGC documents include:

`:edition:`:: The document version; e.g. `2.0`.

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated.

`:copyright-year:` (OGC: `:copyrightYear`):: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued.

`:title:`:: The main component of the English title of the document
(mandatory). (The first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is ignored)

`:doctype:`:: The document type (mandatory). The permitted types are:
+
--
* Standards
`standard`::: Implementation Standard
`standard-with-suite`::: Implementation Standard with Compliance Suite

`:committee:`:: The name of the relevant committee producing the document (mandatory). The legal values are:
`technical`, `planning`, `strategic-member-advisory`
`:subcommittee:`:: The name of the relevant subcommittee producing the document
`:workgroup:` (OGC: `:workingGroup:`):: The name of the relevant working group producing the document (mandatory)

`:language:`:: The language of the document (e.g. `en`) (mandatory)

`:published-date:` (OGC: `:publicationDate:`):: The publication date for the document.
`:issued-date:`  (OGC: `:approvalDate:`):: The approval date for the document.

for this document. (The organisation names themselves may contain commas; e.g.
`University of Calgary, Canada; National Central University, Taiwan`.

`:fullname{_i}:`:: The full name of a person who is a contributor to the document.
A second person is indicated by using a numeric suffix: `:fullname:`, `:fullname_2:`, `fullname_3:`, &c.

they are coded as an `editor`; they can also be represented as an `author`.

OGC `:editor:`:: corresponds to `:fullname:` with `role` = "editor"

== Asciidoctor features specific to OGC

The https://github.com/riboseinc/metanorma-standoc[metanorma-standoc]
gem documents the customisations of Asciidoctor markup common to all metanorma gems.
The following markup is specific to this gem:

=== Section names

The Normative References section may be named just "References", reflecting OGC practice.

=== Preliminary elements

The following clauses are preliminary elements, and are moved into the frontispiece
of the document (in Metanorma, the document preface):

* Abstract
* Keywords
* Preface
* Submitting Organizations
* Submitters

The abstract is recognised as the first clause with an `abstract` style attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[abstract]
== Abstract

xxx
----

The preface is recognised as the text between the Asciidoctor document attributes and
the first Asciidoctor section title; it must not be given a section title of its own.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:received-date: 2019-01-01

.Preface

preface text

=== Submitters
----

Keywords and Submitting Organizations consist of lists. They are treated as document metadata,
and are entered as a document attribute.
The prefatory text introducing them is added automatically.

Submitters are treated as a table, contained in a section with the title `Submitters`:

[source,asciidoc]
----
=== Submitters

|===
|Name |Representing |OGC member

|Steve Liang | University of Calgary, Canada / SensorUp Inc. | Yes
